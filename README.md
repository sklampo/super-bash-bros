# ![Super Bash Bros.](https://fontmeme.com/permalink/201217/e68d3b06f41faa862312491460b69d7e.png)

This is a collection of shell utilities built as [aliases] and [functions] to
aid in software development, primarily targeted for MacOS.

The utilities are documented in detail in their respective directories,
[aliases] and [functions].

## Compatability

The collection is 100% compatible with Bash and almost 100% compatible with
[Z shell].
