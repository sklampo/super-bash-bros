# Contributing Guidelines

If you encounter a bug or have an idea, feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/sklampo/super-bash-bros/issues/new).

## Development

All code must pass the configured linting standards.  For shell, this is
enforced by ShellCheck.  Markdown files are linted with Markdownlint.  Both
tools are configured to in a Git workflow action run on each pull request.
